The predictor is in score.py and requires the file ./params.npy to run properly.
It is written with python3.

For help, execute:
  python3 score.py -h/--help

There is also a test.inp input file, which can be utilized as:

   python3 score.py -i test.fasta [-o test.out]

If an output file is not specified, the output will only print to screen.
To quiet this output, you can supply -q/--quiet.

There is an additional option -d/--detail for a more detailed output to print or be written to the specified output file.
