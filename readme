This is the readme file for the DnaK-peptide forward and reverse binding predictor.

The predictor is in score.py and requires the file params.npy to run properly.

For help, execute:
   python3 score.py -h
or
  python3 score.py --help

There is also a test.inp input file, which can be utilized as:

   python3 score.py -i test.fasta [-o test.out]
By default, if an output destination is not specified, the file inputfilename.out is used.
