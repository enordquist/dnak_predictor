This is the readme file for the Physics-based Model of DnaK-Substrate Binding (PALADIN)

The model is in paladin.py and requires the file ./params.npy to run properly.
It is written with python3.

For help, execute:
  python3 paladin.py -h

There is also a test.inp input file, which can be utilized as:

   python3 paladin.py -i test.fasta [-o test.out]

If an output file is not specified, the output will only print to screen.
To quiet this output, you can supply -q/--quiet.

You should be able to make paladin.py executable and in your path, but
make sure it knows where the params.npy file is (or keep them together).
