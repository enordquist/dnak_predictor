This is the readme file for the Physics-based Model of DnaK-Substrate Binding (PALADIN)

The model is in paladin.py and requires the file ./params.npy to run properly.
It is written with python3.

For help, execute:
  python3 paladin.py -h

There is also a test.inp input file, which can be utilized as:

   python3 paladin.py -i test.fasta [-o test.out]

If an output file is not specified, the output will only print to screen.
To quiet this output, you can supply -q/--quiet.

It should be possible to set up the script to be executable from anywhere,
by editing in paladin.py a variable called path to where the params.npy file lives,
and making paladin.py executable and in your $PATH
